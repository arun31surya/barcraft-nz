                <dl>
                    <dt>Do you supply alcohol?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        No. We run <strong>BYO alcohol</strong> so you control brands and budget. We can guide quantities and a shopping list.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Do you provide glassware?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Glassware can be available depending on guest count and package. If you want it included, mention it in your enquiry.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>How much does a mobile bar in Auckland cost?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        It depends on guest count, hours, menu complexity, and travel. The fastest way is to request a quote with your date,
                        area, and guest count.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Can you run a house party bar where space is tight?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Yes, as long as there’s a safe bar spot and service lane. For this type of event, read:

                    </dd>

                    <dt>What should I send to get an accurate quote?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Date, Auckland area, guest count, approximate hours, and whether you want glassware included. If you want to compare options,
