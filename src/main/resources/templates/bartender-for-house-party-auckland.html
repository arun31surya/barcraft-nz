                <h2>House party bartenders in Auckland, built for speed and vibe</h2>
                <p>
                    A house party can go wrong fast: long queues, messy benches, random bottle “stations”, and someone
                    getting stuck mixing drinks all night instead of hosting. Hiring a <strong>bartender for a house party in Auckland</strong>
                    is about more than pouring. It’s about managing the pace, keeping the bar clean, and serving a menu that works for your crowd.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We work across <strong>Auckland CBD</strong>, <strong>North Shore</strong>, <strong>West Auckland</strong>,
                    <strong>East Auckland</strong>, and <strong>South Auckland</strong>. You’ll get a proper bar footprint,
                    professional tools, and a simple system that keeps the energy up.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fast service</strong> with a menu designed to reduce waiting</li>
                    <li><strong>Clean bar area</strong> so your place stays tidy</li>
                    <li><strong>BYO alcohol</strong>, you control brands and budget</li>
                    <li><strong>Glassware options</strong> depending on guest count and package</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What you get when you hire BarCraft NZ for a house party</h2>
                <p>
                    We keep it simple and practical. House parties need speed and consistency, not a menu that takes two minutes per drink.
                    We’ll recommend a tight list that still feels premium and covers different tastes.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Professional bartender service</strong> with a calm, controlled flow</li>
                    <li><strong>Premium bar setup</strong> that looks sharp and photographs well</li>
                    <li><strong>Menu guidance</strong> for cocktails, mocktails, and crowd-friendly classics</li>
                    <li><strong>Shopping guidance</strong> for alcohol quantities (so you don’t overbuy)</li>
                    <li><strong>Pack-down</strong> so you’re not left with a mess at the end</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    If your event is bigger than a typical house party (or you want a full bar look),
                    view the main <a th:href="@{/mobile-bar-auckland}">mobile bar Auckland</a> page.

                <h2>Mini FAQ</h2>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Do you supply alcohol for house parties?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        No. We run <strong>BYO alcohol</strong>. You choose brands and budget, and we can guide quantities and what to buy.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>How many guests is this suited for?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Typical house party bookings are around 20–80 guests, but it depends on space, hours, and menu complexity.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Do you provide glassware?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Glassware can be available depending on guest count and package. Mention it in your enquiry so it’s included in the quote.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>What’s the best drink menu for a house party?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        A short curated list wins. It keeps service fast and guests happier. If you want a full breakdown,
                        check <a th:href="@{/packages}">packages</a> for options.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Can you do weddings or corporate events too?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Yes. Those have different service needs. See
